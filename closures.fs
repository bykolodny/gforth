: [{: ( compilation -- hmaddr u latest wid 0 ; instantiation ... -- xt ) \ gforth-experimental start-closure
    \G Starts a closure.  Closures started with @code{[@{:} define
    \G locals for use inside the closure.  The locals-definition part
    \G ends with @code{:@}l}, @code{:@}h}, @code{:@}h1}, @code{:@}d}
    \G or @code{:@}xt}.  The rest of the closure definition is Forth
    \G code.  The closure ends with @code{;]}.  When the closure
    \G definition is encountered during execution (closure creation
    \G time), the values going into the locals are consumed, and an
    \G execution token (xt) is pushed on the stack; when that
    \G execution token is executed (with @code{execute}, through
    \G @code{compile,} or a deferred word), the code in the closure is
    \G executed (closure execution time).  If the xt of a closure is
    \G executed multiple times, the values of the locals at the start
    \G of code execution are those from closure-creation time,
    \G unaffected by any locals-changes in earlier executions of the
    \G closure.
