',' Value csv-separator ( -- c ) \ gforth-experimental
\G CSV field separator (default is `,', hence the name
\G "comma-separated"); this is a value and can be
\G changed with @code{to csv-separator}.

'"' Value csv-quote ( -- c ) \ gforth-experimental
\G CSV quote character (default is `"'); this is a value and can be
\G changed with @code{to csv-quote}.

true Value quote-state \ if true, a separator is visible
